// Session-scoped memory of resolved class neighbourhoods, so a node that has been
// expanded once is never re-resolved against the LSP while it stays valid. This is
// both a speed win (browsing a cached graph fires zero LSP queries) and a
// correctness win: a node's caller/dependency counts are computed exactly once, so
// focusing it and later clicking it can never disagree (the click just replays the
// cached expansion instead of re-querying a differently-loaded language server).
//
// Validity is split in two, because a neighbourhood has two kinds of data:
//   • intrinsic  — the node's own dependencies + inheritance. A pure function of its
//                  own file content, so it is valid as long as `ownHash` matches.
//   • extrinsic  — its callers + siblings. These depend on *other* files (who
//                  references it, who implements its parent), so they are valid only
//                  within the same workspace `epoch`. Any source-file save bumps the
//                  epoch, marking every node's extrinsic data as stale on next touch.
